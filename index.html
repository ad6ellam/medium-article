        <h1>How to Raise Money for Your Startup Faster and with Less Effort</h1>
        <p>You’re too busy to raise money. So here’s an efficient and cost-effective way to raise early-stage investment for your startup.</p>

      <h2>The Strategy In a Nutshell</h2>
      <p>
        "Raising money is time-consuming physically and all-consuming cognitively. And all the time that you’re raising money, you aren’t running the company. You need to improve your efficiency or you are going to ruin all that hard work you put into making something incredible.
        But there is light at the end of the tunnel and in this article, I’m going to share methods that can help you to significantly accelerate your early-stage fundraising and so you can start getting down to the good stuff.
        Note: These are techniques to improve traction with gaining investment with less effort and in a quicker timeframe. But remember, the secret sauce to raising money is having an exceptional product, in a growing market with a world-beating team. But you already knew that, and have all three."
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1 — Be noticeable</h2>
      <p>
        There are no actual stats on how many pitches an Angel, syndicate or early stage fund gets each week (because most of them talk a much bigger game than the truth). But I am not a particularly active angel, and get three or so a week, and others in my network get up to ten. That could be over 500 a year. 500!!! If you were to get over 500 of anything a year, it would take something serious to make it stand out.
        Therefore, consider what is special about you and your company. What do you have that nobody else does and can make you stand out from those other inbox fillers?
        Four areas you can stand out -
          * IDEA — Is your concept world changing like an iPhone?
          * MARKET — Is your market growing faster than a Christmas waistline?
          * TEAM — Are you and your team the startup equivalent of the Justice League?
          * TRACTION — Is your traction like an early Facebook?
          * UNFAIR ADVANTAGE — Are you 14 times world whittling champion and making a new knife?
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        "Raising money is hard work and time-consuming. Maximise your chances of success by managing your time as best you can. As with every round, there will be lots of ‘no’s’ but fear not, if you stick to the path, take feedback well and adjust, you will win."
